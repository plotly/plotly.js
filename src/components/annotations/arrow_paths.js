/**
 * All paths are tuned for maximum scalability of the arrowhead,
 * ie throughout arrowwidth=0.3..3 the head is joined smoothly
 * to the line, with the line coming from the left and ending at (0, 0).
 *
 * `backoff` is the distance to move the arrowhead and the end of the line,
 * in order that the arrowhead points to the desired place, either at
 * the tip of the arrow or (in the case of circle or square)
 * the center of the symbol.
 *
 * `noRotate`, if truthy, says that this arrowhead should not rotate with the
 * arrow. That's the case for squares, which should always be straight, and
 * circles, for which it's irrelevant.
