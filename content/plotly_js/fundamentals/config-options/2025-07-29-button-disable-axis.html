     Disabling the zoom in, zoom out, and autoscale buttons for specific axes is supported on cartesian axes using the `modebardisable` attribute. In the following example, the zoom in and zoom out buttons are disabled on the `xaxis`, meaning these buttons only zoom in and out on the `yaxis`. Disable the autoscale button using `modebardisable='autoscale'`. You can also disable both autoscaling and zoom buttons using `modebardisable='zoominout+autoscale'`.
