  Plotly graphs which use WebGL receive a "WebGL context" from the browser which gives them access to gpu resources.
  A program may lose its WebGL context if the browser is overloaded with them and is forced to shut one down.
  The event handler: `plotly_webglcontextlost`, can be used to trigger an event after a graph loses it's WebGL context.
