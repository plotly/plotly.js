  Stephen Few's Bullet Chart was invented to replace dashboard [gauges](https://plotly.com/javascript/gauge-charts/) and meters, combining both types of charts into simple bar charts with qualitative bars (steps), quantitative bar (bar) and performance line (threshold); all into one simple layout.
  Steps typically are broken into several values, which are defined with an array. The bar represent the actual value that a particular variable reached, and the threshold usually indicate a goal point relative to the value achieved by the bar. See [indicator page](https://plotly.com/javascript/gauge-charts/) for more detail.

var data = [
  {
    type: "indicator",
    mode: "number+gauge+delta",
    gauge: { shape: "bullet" },
    delta: { reference: 300 },
    value: 220,
    domain: { x: [0, 1], y: [0, 1] },
    title: { text: "Profit" }
  }
];

var layout = { width: 600, height: 250 };
Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data, layout);
