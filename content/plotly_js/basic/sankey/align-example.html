  You can set the alignment of nodes using `node.align`. In this example, we align nodes to the "right". `node.align` can also be set to "left", "center", or "justify". The default is "justify" if ``node.align` is not set, and is similar to aligning to the "left", except that nodes without outgoing links are moved to the right of the figure.

var data = {
  type: "sankey",
  orientation: "h",
  node: {
    label: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    align: "right",
  },

  link: {
    source: [0, 1, 4, 2, 1],
    target: [1, 4, 5, 4, 3],
    value: [4, 2, 3, 1, 2],
  },
};

var data = [data];

var layout = {
  title: {
    text: "Align Nodes (Right)"
  },
  font: {
    size: 10,
  },
};

Plotly.newPlot('myDiv', data, layout);
