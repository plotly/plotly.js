  The parallel categories diagram is a visualization of multi-dimensional categorical data sets.  Each variable in
  the data set is represented by a column of rectangles, where each rectangle corresponds to a discrete value
  taken on by that variable.  The relative heights of the rectangles reflect the relative frequency of occurrence of
  the corresponding value.

  Combinations of category rectangles across dimensions are connected by ribbons, where the height of the ribbon
  corresponds to the relative frequency of occurrence of the combination of categories in the data set.

  In this example, we visualize the hair color, eye color, and sex of a sample of 8 people.  Hovering over a
  category rectangle displays a tooltip with the number of people with that single trait. Hovering over a ribbon
  in the diagram displays a tooltip with the number of people with a particular combination of the three
  traits connected by the ribbon.

  The dimension labels can be dragged horizontally to reorder the dimensions and the category rectangles can be
  dragged vertically to reorder the categories within a dimension.
