We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Bootstrap theme.



## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.0.x).
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems. We use Pygments for syntax highlighting, so make sure to read the sections on installing Python and Pygments.
2. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/> while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.
