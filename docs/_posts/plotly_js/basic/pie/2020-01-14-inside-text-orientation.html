  The `insidetextorientation` attribute controls the orientation of the text inside chart sectors. When set to *auto*, text may be oriented in any direction in order to be as big as possible in the middle of a sector. The *horizontal* option orients text to be parallel with the bottom of the chart, and may make text smaller in order to achieve that goal. The *radial* option orients text along the radius of the sector. The *tangential* option orients text perpendicular to the radius of the sector.
