[Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript) is a standalone Javascript data visualization library, and it also powers the Python and R modules named `plotly` in those respective ecosystems (referred to as [Plotly.py](https://plotly.com/python) and [Plotly.R](http://plotly.com/r)).

Plotly.js can be used to produce dozens of chart types and visualizations, including statistical charts, 3D graphs, scientific charts, SVG and tile maps, financial charts and more.

## Load as a node module
Install [a ready-to-use distributed bundle](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md)
```sh
npm i --save plotly.js-dist-min
```

and use import or require in node.js
```js
// ES6 module
import Plotly from 'plotly.js-dist-min'

// CommonJS
var Plotly = require('plotly.js-dist-min')
```

You may also consider using [`plotly.js-dist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plotly.js-dist) if you prefer using an unminified package.

---
## Load via script tag

### The script HTML element
> In the examples below `Plotly` object is added to the window scope by `script`. The `newPlot` method is then used to draw an interactive figure as described by `data` and `layout` into the desired `div` here named `gd`. As demonstrated in the example above basic knowledge of `html` and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) syntax is enough to get started i.e. with/without JavaScript! To learn and build more with plotly.js please visit [plotly.js documentation](https://plotly.com/javascript).

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.27.1.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="gd"></div>

    <script>
        Plotly.newPlot("gd", /* JSON object */ {
            "data": [{ "y": [1, 2, 3] }],
            "layout": { "width": 600, "height": 400}
        })
    </script>
</body>
```

Alternatively you may consider using [native ES6 import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) in the script tag.
```html
<script type="module">
    import "https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.27.1.min.js"
    Plotly.newPlot("gd", [{ y: [1, 2, 3] }])
</script>
```

Fastly supports Plotly.js with free CDN service. Read more at <https://www.fastly.com/open-source>.

### Un-minified versions are also available on CDN
While non-minified source files may contain characters outside UTF-8, it is recommended that you specify the `charset` when loading those bundles.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.27.1.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

> Please note that as of v2 the "plotly-latest" outputs (e.g. https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js) will no longer be updated on the CDN, and will stay at the last v1 patch v1.58.5. Therefore, to use the CDN with plotly.js v2 and higher, you must specify an exact plotly.js version.

### MathJax
You could load either version two or version three of MathJax files, for example:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG.js"></script>
```

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-svg.js"></script>
```

> When using MathJax version 3, it is also possible to use `chtml` output on the other parts of the page in addition to `svg` output for the plotly graph.
Please refer to `devtools/test_dashboard/index-mathjax3chtml.html` to see an example.


## Bundles
There are two kinds of plotly.js bundles:
1. Complete and partial official bundles that are distributed to `npm` and the `CDN`, described in [the dist README](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md).
2. Custom bundles you can create yourself to optimize the size of bundle depending on your needs. Please visit [CUSTOM_BUNDLE](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CUSTOM_BUNDLE.md) for more information.

## Alternative ways to load and build plotly.js
If your library needs to bundle or directly load [plotly.js/lib/index.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/lib/index.js) or parts of its modules similar to [index-basic](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/lib/index-basic.js) in some other way than via an official or a custom bundle, or in case you want to tweak the default build configurations, then please visit [`BUILDING.md`](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/BUILDING.md).
